	<p>Looks like this in Hebrew: <span dir="rtl">אה, אני אוהב להיות ליד חוף הים</span></p>
	<p>In the computer's memory, this is stored as <bdo dir="ltr">אה, אני אוהב להיות ליד חוף הים</bdo></p>

	<!-- <dfn> is used to indicate the term being defined within the context of a definition phrase or sentence. The <p> element, the <dt>/<dd> pairing, or the <section> element which is the nearest ancestor of the <dfn> is considered to be the definition of the term. -->

	<hr>
	<!-- <i> represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element -->
	<p>I looked at it and thought <i>This can't be real!</i></p>

	<hr>
	<!-- The <kbd> represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a <kbd> element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard -->
	<p>Please press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to re-render an MDN page.</p>

		the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to
		destroy an entire planet.

			漢 <rp>(</rp><rt>Kan</rt><rp>)</rp>

	<!-- <rt> specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. -->

	<hr>
	<!-- <s> renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the <del> and <ins> elements, as appropriate -->

	<p>SOLD OUT!</p>
	

	<hr>

	<p><samp>Keyboard not found <br>Press F1 to continue</samp></p>

	<!-- <span> is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> is an inline element -->
	<p>Add the <span style="color: #f00;">basil</span>, <span style="color: #f00;">pine nuts</span> and <span style="color: #f00;">garlic</span> to a blender and blend into a paste.</p>
	<p>Gradually add the <span style="color: #f00;">olive oil</span> while running the blender slowly.</p>

	<hr>
	<!-- <strong> indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type -->

	<!-- <strong> element is for content that is of greater importance, while the <b> element is used to draw attention to text without indicating that it's more important! -->
	
	<hr>
	<!-- <sub> specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text -->

	<hr>
	<!-- <u> represents a span of inline text which should be rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation. This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be altered using CSS. -->
	<p>You could use this element to highlight <u>speling</u> mistakes, so the writer can <u>corect</u> them.</p>
	<!-- Avoid using the <u> element with its default styling (of underlined text) in such a way as to be confused with a hyperlink, which is also underlined by default -->
	<!-- Valid use cases for the <u> element include annotating spelling errors, applying a proper name mark to denote proper names in Chinese text, and other forms of annotation -->
	<!-- You should not use <u> to underline text for presentation purposes, or to denote titles of books. -->

	<hr>
	<!-- <var> represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context. It's typically presented using an italicized version of the current typeface, although that behavior is browser-dependent. -->
	<p>The volume of a box is <var style="font-weight: bold">l</var> × <var style="font-weight: bold">w</var> × <var style="font-weight: bold">h</var>, where <var style="font-weight: bold">l</var> represents the length, <var style="font-weight: bold">w</var> the width and <var style="font-weight: bold">h</var> the height of the box.</p>

	<hr>
